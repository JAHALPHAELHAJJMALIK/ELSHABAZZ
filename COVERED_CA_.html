                <h2>What is Covered California?</h2>
                <p>Covered California is the state's health insurance marketplace, established under the Affordable Care Act. It helps individuals and small businesses find affordable health coverage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-card">
                <h2>2024 Silver Plan Updates</h2>
                <p>For Californians earning between 200%-250% of the federal poverty level, there are significant cost reductions in the Silver plan for 2024, including $0 in-patient hospital stay and lower costs for primary care visits, therapy, and generic drugs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-card">
                <h2>Program Eligibility</h2>
                <p>Eligibility for Covered California programs depends on your income relative to the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Various plans and financial assistance options are available based on your FPL percentage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-card">
                <h2>Individual Mandate Status</h2>
                <p>While the federal individual mandate penalty was set to $0 in 2019, California has implemented its own state-level mandate. Californians must have qualifying health insurance or face a state penalty, unless they qualify for an exemption.</p>
            </div>
			
            <div class="info-card">
                <h2>RMB: Required Minimum Benefits</h2>
                <p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, requires health insurance plans to cover certain essential health benefits. Here are the 10 required minimum benefits:<br><br>
				1.	Ambulatory patient services (outpatient care)<br>
				2.	Emergency services<br>
				3.	Hospitalization<br>
				4.	Maternity and newborn care<br>
				5.	Mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment<br>
				6.	Prescription drugs<br>
				7.	Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices<br>
				8.	Laboratory services<br>
				9.	Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management<br>
				10.	Pediatric services, including oral and vision care<br><br>
				These essential health benefits must be included in all individual and small group health insurance plans sold both on and off the Health Insurance Marketplace. Large group health plans and self-insured plans are not required to offer all of these benefits, but most do.
				It's worth noting that while these are the minimum required benefits, many plans offer additional coverage beyond these essentials. The specific details of coverage can vary between plans and states.
